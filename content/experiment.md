That is more or less the main idea behind this website and our experiments.

We create some limited run of chocolate, making available the finished product
as well the recipe and the ingredients we use to make it.

Opensource Themed Chocolate
---------------------------
{: .bgreen}

We love opensource and we are creating many different special chocolates
inspired by the opensource project we like and let us using their name on
our creations.

Currently we made chocolate for [Libav](http://libav.org) and [VLC](http://videolan.org), any organization that wants their own chocolate can contact us.

Experimental Chocolate
----------------------

We like to try new recipes and we like to share at least some of them, the
most promising will be added to our [github](http://github.com/borgodoro/choco).

As a general rule we always offer in our [webshop](http://shop.borgodoro.it)
all the ingredients needed. Currently we can just give you wholesale quantities.
