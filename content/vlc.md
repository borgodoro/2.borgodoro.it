VLC Chocolate
=============

> VLC is one of the best players around, works everywhere, plays everything,
> we love it.

Our guarana and liquorice chocolate hads been inspired by the efforts spent
by the VLC developers.

While thinking about the orange and white cone we thought about the bright
orange guarana fruits and its high coffeine contents.
