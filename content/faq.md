Frequently Answered Questions
=============================

### What is that?

> This is the little web corner devoted to opensource experiments about
> Chocolate!

### Why?

> Borgodoro mission is to make high quality food available for the right price,
> Opensource made it possible for the software and we have great examples such
> as Android or the web servers we use daily. We got convinced we can try as
> well with food recipes.

### Ok but software is immaterial!

> So recipes are, you still need tools and material, but is nice to know in
> detail what you are eating where it comes from and maybe even try at home
> making what you liked or even improve it.
> We will even [sell](http://leonardofood.com) you our ingredients so you
> can try making your own version from scratch.

### Ok, deal so what is for me?

> Here you will find the recipes we used to make some chocolate, the mentioned
> chocolate in ready-to-eat form and even the ready-to-use ingredients.

### Why LGPL? Why not $license?

> - First, recipes are not really copyrightable so we are putting the license
>   only as goodwill guideline.
> - Second, LGPL is a good balance between sharing and being able to keep for
>   you.
> - Third, the first project we are making chocolate for is using this license
>   so felt right using it.

### Why starting with a VLC chocolate?

> Somebody has a long tradition of bringing chocolate from our city around
> meetings and he happens to be part of VLC.
>
> Apparently even the other VLC developers liked our
> [MrBlack](http://borgodoro.it/choco/mrblack) bars he brought with him.
>
> We like VLC and we thought it would be fun trying first making a chocolate
> fitting.

### Where the money goes?

> For each box sold part of the money will get back to VLC, the rest keeps
> making this project bigger.

### Do you plan to make chocolate for other opensource projects?

> Yes if there is interest and this first run results successful, feel free
> to drop us a [line](mailto:sales@leonardofood.com) if you are part of an
> opensource project that would like a custom chocolate.

### Will you keep making the VLC chocolate?

> Maybe.
>
> This is a limited run so if you like our highly energetic dark chocolate
> you should hurry!
